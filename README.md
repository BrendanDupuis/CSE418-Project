Description:

We will be developing an instant messaging app which includes secure messaging, with explicit confidentiality and integrity defenses. Our instant messaging app will incorporate most of the general necessities that one would need for a typical messaging app that you could find on your typical devices. The project will have a simple, yet secure way of signing up, logging in, and password resetting if needed in order to keep our app easy to use. We are going to incorporate end-to-end encryption to ensure no messages, files, or sensitive data are stored on the server in plaintext, even temporarily. Furthermore, we will incorporate features such as delivery status, and offline messaging. To keep our users up to date, we also offer real-time notifications if they receieve a new message, and also alerts of suspicious activity such as login changes, or key changes.
